        A quick visual example of the current coding skills aquired. Let's talk
        about what I have learned.

      <hr />
      <br />
      <p>
        The path. It sounds like something out of a life changing film or book.
        That is not what we are getting at here. This is my personal path on
        becoming a Web Developer. This is my first week of programming, and from
        what I understand, I am in the honeymoon phase.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I have decided where to start. This is a harder decision to marker thank
        it sounds. I dabbled in C# and Python, but I decided that is not where I
        am going to begin. So where am I starting?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am going with HTML and CSS. This is my first step. From here I plan on
        moving upword to Javascript, React, and Git.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am building my path according to what I see as the industry standard.
        Though it is possible for my opinion to change on this, and I am decide
        to go in a different direction.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Eventually I would like to get into UI/UX android developement and game
        dev. For now I will work on Web developement.

        />
      </a>

      <p>
        So, this is why I am making a point to create a functioning website and
        utilize all the skills and techniques I have learned so far. With this I
        can not only practice and progress my skills, I will have a record of my
        progress and marker by time to track my improvements as I go along.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This will be useful for me in several ways. If I decided to publish this
        page, hopefully it is useful to you as well. Thank you for checking in
        with me on my first week. This is very exciting for me. Until next week!
